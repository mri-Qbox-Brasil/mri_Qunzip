**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hello ! Today I'm releasing `mth-cinematic`, a standalone resource that allows you to configure a welcome cinematic for your new players. See the showcase video below to see how it works !

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, put the `mth-cinematic` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start mth-cinematic` to your server.cfg
Then, in another CLIENT script, trigger the `mth-cinematic:start` event

**Features :sparkles: :**
* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Easy to use
* FREE
* Configurable
* Can show text, configure the time of each sequence and more !



*Demo :eyes:  :*
